Greetings. 

This is my portfolio of projects from the Post Graduate Certificate in Data Science and Business Analytics
ðŸŽ“ University of Texas at Austin

Over time I will revise each project to include:
  - readme
  - Python code file (.ipynb file)
  - Python code file (.html)
  - Presentation file (.pdf)

Ideally, future students of the program, you are using these are reference only and abiding by the honor code of the program.

Project Structure:
 - We were proided a Business Context, Objective, Data Description, and a Dataset.
 - Generally speaking the data had a small amount of preprocessing required, including duplicat4e values, missing values, outliers to address, and oftern for ease some feature engineering. However I would not categorize any project as including real-world data cleaning.
 - From there, we were largely on our own to determine appropriate EDA, Visualizations, Model Building, Tuning, and to present a consise set of conclusions. Typically we did either a "Full Code" project or a "Buisness Presentation" project, but I will be endevoring to produce both for each project as I revise and apply my continuously growing skill set.
